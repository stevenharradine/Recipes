## How To:
### Freezing The Freezer Bowl
The most important step in making frozen desserts is to make sure the Freezer Bowl is properly frozen.  Your Ice Cream Maker features a double insulated bowl and requires thorough freezing.  The length of time necessary to properly freeze the Freezer Bowl will depend on how cold the freezer temperature is.

| Freezer Temperature | Approx. Min. Freezing Time |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| -30‎°C/-22‎°F         | 8-9 hours                  |
| -25‎°C/-13‎°F         | 12-13 hours                |
| -18‎°C/0‎°F           | 20-22 hours                |
| -15‎°C/5‎°F           | 24 hours or more           |

As there is liquid in between the Freezer Bowl walls, shake the Freezer Bowl to check the ideal freezing condition; you should not hear any liquid moving within the walls.

**NOTE:** Continually storing the Freezer Bowl in the freezer allows you the flexibility to make your favorite froen desserts at a moments notice.
