 * **Prep time**: 15 minutes
 * **Cook time**: 20 minutes
 * **Total time**: 1 hour 5 minutes

## Ingredients
 * 22.5 ounces bread flour, plus more for dusting (630g; about 4 1/2 cups)
 * .5 ounces sugar (15g; about 1 1/2 tablespoons)
 * .35 ounces kosher salt (10g; about 1 tablespoon)
 * .35 ounces instant yeast, such as SAF Instant Yeast (10g; about 2 teaspoons)
 * 1.125 ounces Extra Virgin olive oil (32g; about 3 tablespoons)
 * 15 ounces lukewarm water (420g; about 1 3/4 cups)

## Directions
1. In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
2. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups bread flour, olive oil, salt, white sugar and the yeast mixture; stir well to combine. Beat well until a stiff dough has formed. Cover and rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
3. Turn dough out onto a well floured surface. Form dough into a round and roll out into a pizza crust shape. Cover with your favorite sauce and toppings and bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes.
