# Chinese Orange Chicken
 * Prep Time: 40 minutes
 * Cook Time: 10 minutes
 * Total Time: 50 minutes
 * Yield: 4 servings

## Ingredients
 * 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch chunks
 * 1 cup 2 tablespoons cornstarch, divided
 * 2 large eggs, beaten
 * 1 cup vegetable oil
 * 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds
 * 1 green onion, thinly sliced

### For the marinade
 * 1 cup chicken broth
 * 1/2 cup freshly squeezed orange juice
 * 1/2 cup sugar
 * 1/3 cup distilled white vinegar
 * 1/4 cup soy sauce
 * 2 cloves garlic, minced
 * 1 tablespoon orange zest
 * 1 teaspoon Sriracha, or more, to taste
 * 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
 * 1/4 teaspoon white pepper

## Instructions
1. To make the marinade, whisk together chicken broth, orange juice, sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, orange zest, Sriracha, ginger and white pepper in a large bowl.
2. In a gallon size Ziploc bag or large bowl, combine chicken and 2/3 cup of the marinade; marinate for at least 30 minutes, turning the bag occasionally. Drain the chicken from the marinade, discarding the marinade.
3. Heat remaining marinade in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil and stir in 2 tablespoons cornstarch combined with 2 tablespoons water. Cook, stirring frequently, until thickened about 1-2 minutes; keep warm.
4. Working one at a time, dip the chicken into the eggs, then dredge in remaining 1 cup cornstarch, pressing to coat.
5. Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan. Working in batches, add chicken and fry until golden brown and cooked through, about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; discard excess oil.

Serve chicken immediately, tossed or drizzled with the marinade, garnished with sesame seeds and green onion, if desired.
