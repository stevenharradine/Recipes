## Ingredients
 * 4 large eggs
 * 1 cup whole milk
 * 1 cup all purpose flour
 * 1 tsp salt
 * 1/4 cup vegetable oil or beef drippings

## Directions
1. Set a rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, flour and salt until smooth. Set aside.
3. Place 1 tsp (5 mL) oil or beef drippings into each cup of a 12-cup muffin pan. Transfer pan to oven and heat until oil is smoking, about 2 minutes.
4. Remove pan from oven and quickly pour batter into cups, filling 2/3 full. Bake until puddings have risen and are golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve immediately.

**Tip:** To help ensure your Yorkshire puddings rise, avoid overfilling the tin. If you pour too much batter into each individual compartment, the pudding will begin to rise, but will then collapse because it is too heavy. To avoid this, only fill each compartment to be about 2/3 full.
