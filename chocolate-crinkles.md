## Ingredients
* 1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 1/2 cups white granulated sugar
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 4 eggs
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon espresso powder (optional)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup confectioners’ sugar

## Directions
1. Beat together cocoa powder, white sugar, vegetable oil: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (or beat by hand with a wooden spoon) beat together the cocoa powder, white sugar, and vegetable oil until it comes together into a shiny, gritty, black dough of sorts.
2. Add eggs, one at a time, add vanilla: Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing for 30 seconds each. Add the vanilla and beat in thoroughly.
3. Whisk together flour, baking powder, salt, espresso powder: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder if using.
4. Beat dry ingredients into cocoa oil mix: Mix into the chocolate mixture on low speed until just combined. Do not overbeat.
5. Cover and chill: Cover the dough with plastic wrap and chill the dough for four hours or overnight.
6. Roll dough into balls, roll into powdered sugar, place on cookie sheet: Preheat the oven to 350°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper. Place the confectioner's sugar in a wide bowl.
Using a rounded teaspoon get clumps of the chilled dough and roll them into 1-inch (2.5 cm) sized balls using your hands.
Roll the balls in the confectioner's sugar and place on the cookie sheets (you should be able to get 12-16 on each sheet).
7. Bake: Bake at 350°F for 10-12 minutes. Allow to cool a minute or two on the sheets before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
